<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am Sandro Ecora, a 23-years-old aspiring web developer from Germany,<br />
  currently taking a full-stack development course. My goal is to build<br />
  versitile web applications, including a project management tool.
</p>

<p>
  With a background in C# within the Unity Engine, I discovered my passion for<br />
  programming. Now, I'm expanding my skills by learning HTML as my first step<br />
  towards mastering front-end and back-end development, with plans to master<br />
  CSS, JavaScript and others soon.
</p>

<p>
  I'm committed to creating responsive, well-structured web applications that<br />
  offer real value to every user.
